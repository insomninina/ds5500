Project 1 works with Kaggle American Express dataset on credit card default. The goal is to create, evaluate, and tune models for the classification of users as either 0 (user did not default) or 1 (user defaulted on their credit card). The initial plan was to create and compare Random Forest and XGBoost models, and then to determine the effects of random oversampling to determine whether the effects of Almustfa, Khatir, and Bee's approach in their 2021 paper in 'Risks' holds true for our data as well.
