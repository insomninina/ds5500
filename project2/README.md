## Sentiment Analysis Using Amazon Reviews

Project 2 works with Stanford University dataset on Amazon reviews. The goal is to clean and preprocess data for embedding using Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec embedding and then predict for the test set using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. Then we will test the same process using multiclass sentiment analysis.
